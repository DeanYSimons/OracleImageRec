This program utalizes YOLO11 (You Only Look Omce) by Ultralytics to detect opbjects, in this case human people.
It will play one of three sounds based off of RNG when a person is detected.
50% for "Hey"      40% for "AHHHHHHHHHH"       10% for sad music.

Uses recognition and timers, ran out of time to do object tracking. ;-;
